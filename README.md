## Introduction

Robotites is an autonomous driving bot which uses cutting-edge technology that aims to make vehicles navigate and operate without constant human intervention. Through the combination of advanced sensors, real-time data processing, and futuristic programming, the Robotites is designed to analyze the surrounding environment, make informed decisions, and guide road safety. This holds the potential to redefine traffic conditions and offer a glimpse of the future where transportation becomes smarter, safer, and more convenient than ever.
