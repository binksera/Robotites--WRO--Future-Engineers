## Introduction

Robotites is an autonomous driving bot which uses cutting-edge technology that aims to make vehicles navigate and operate without constant human intervention. Through the combination of advanced sensors, real-time data processing, and futuristic programming, the Robotites is designed to analyze the surrounding environment, make informed decisions, and guide road safety. This holds the potential to redefine traffic conditions and offer a glimpse of the future where transportation becomes smarter, safer, and more convenient than ever.

## Engineering Materials

This repository contains the following engineering materials:

- Gyro Sensor

- Color Sensor

- Ultrasonic Sensor

- Servo Motors

- Lego Mindstorm EV3

**Mobility Management:**

Servo Motors -  is a type of rotary actuator that allows precise control of angular position, velocity, and acceleration. We use the servo motor to create a steering mechanism positioned at the forefront of the robot.

DC Motors - The core of a servo motor is a DC motor, which generates the mechanical motion. We employed 2 coupled large motors positioned at the rear end. These motors function cohesively to constitute the driving force responsible for propelling the robot in a forward direction.

Brick - The brain of our robot, the Lego Mindstorms EV3 intelligent brick gathers information coming from the sensors, processes it and sends commands to the motors for an efficient and amazing autonomous ride.

**Power and Sense Management:**

Gyro Sensor - The gyro sensor helps in detecting the rate of rotations by measuring the angles. It is placed left to the brick lower body in our robot to assist it in rotations. The gyro sensor detects rotational motion in the plane indicated by the arrows on the top of the sensor housing. The sensor measures the rate of rotation in degrees per second and keeps track of the total angle of rotation in degrees.

Color Sensor -  A color sensor is a device that detects and distinguishes colors. It uses light sources like LEDs to illuminate objects, and a detector array with light-sensitive elements to capture the reflected or transmitted light. By analyzing the intensity of light at different wavelengths, the sensor calculates the color of the object using algorithms. The output signal represents the detected color and can be communicated to other devices for further processing.

Ultrasonic Sensor - A device that uses sound waves of very high frequency (ultrasonic waves) to measure distances, detect objects, or map environments. It's commonly used in applications such as proximity sensing and object detection.

**Obstacle Management:**

Obstacle management for the EV3 robot involves programming it to detect and navigate around obstacles using sensors like ultrasonic and color sensors. In the programming environment, you create code to measure distances or detect physical contact with obstacles. Based on sensor inputs, the robot makes decisions and executes avoidance maneuvers by controlling its motors. The engineers utilized one of the sensors or a combination of sensors for more sophisticated obstacle avoidance. Testing and refining the code are important for achieving effective obstacle management with the EV3 robot.
